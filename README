You have three ways of activating the gem:

Use
require 'activemodel-warnings'
to have attr_accessor :skip_warnings.

Use
require 'activemodel-warnings/boolean'
if you want the attribute of skip_warning=(attribute) method to be parsed with global Boolean() method
ex. provided with GlobalBoolean.kernel!

Use
require 'activemodel-warnings/global_boolean'
if you want the attribute of skip_warnings=(attribute) to be parsed with GlobalBoolean.Boolean() method
ex. provided by global_boolean gam but without executing GlobalBoolean.kernel!


Be sure to require global_boolean before require of this gem.
If using bundler then just put the declaration of global_boolean in Gemfile above activemodel-warnings
